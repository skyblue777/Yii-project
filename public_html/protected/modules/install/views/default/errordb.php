    <h2>Error establishing a database connection</h2>
    <p>This either means that the username and password information are incorrect or we can't contact the database server. This could mean your host's database server is down.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are you sure you have the correct username and password?</li>
        <li>Are you sure that you have typed the correct hostname?</li>
        <li>Are you sure that the database server is running?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're unsure what these terms mean you should probably contact your host.</p>
